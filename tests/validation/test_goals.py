"""The runtimes the package has to meet, each set by an external framework (issue #972).

Each :class:`~tests.validation._goals.Goal` is a framework's runtime on a
declared fixture, measured on the 4-core reference host by the benchmark pair
its row names and written here as a number. The test times the package alone,
so no framework is installed to run it, and it fails until the package's
median meets the figure. It carries `goal` and runs in a non-blocking step of
CI's `validation` job.

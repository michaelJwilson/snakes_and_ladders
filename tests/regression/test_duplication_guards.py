"""The three duplications issue #230 closed, asserted rather than remembered.

A consolidation that nothing enforces is a consolidation with a half-life.
Each of the three below was written between four and twelve times before it
had one home, and each grew *after* the survey that counted it was filed:
edge iteration doubled from six sites to twelve while the ticket waited.

Each guard is paired with a test that the guard fails on a violating input.
That pairing is the discipline `tests/regression/docs` established: a check
that has never been seen to fail is not known to work, and a regex over
source files is exactly the kind that silently matches nothing.

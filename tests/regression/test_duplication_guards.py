"""The duplications issues #230 and #413 closed, asserted rather than remembered.

A consolidation that nothing enforces is a consolidation with a half-life.
Each of the three below was written between four and twelve times before it
had one home, and each grew *after* the survey that counted it was filed:
edge iteration doubled from six sites to twelve while the ticket waited.

The fourth is a *value* rather than a routine, and its guard reaches wider
than the package: the exact transition a fixture is declared at was written
as a float in a test and again in a notebook cell, and the two agreed by
coincidence of two literals rather than by construction (issue #413). A
closed form computed in three places is the same defect as a function
implemented in three places, so it is checked the same way.

Each guard is paired with a test that the guard fails on a violating input.
That pairing is the discipline `tests/regression/docs` established: a check
that has never been seen to fail is not known to work, and a regex over
source files is exactly the kind that silently matches nothing.
